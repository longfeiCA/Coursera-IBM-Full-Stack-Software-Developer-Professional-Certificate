Lesson 1 Summary: Service Models
In this lesson, you have learned the following:

With IaaS, the cloud provider manages physical resources. 

With PaaS, the provider manages the platform infrastructure. 

In the SaaS model, the provider hosts and manages the applications and data.

Infrastructure-as-a-Service is a form of cloud computing that delivers fundamental computer, network, and storage resources to consumers on-demand, over the network, on a pay-as-you-go basis. 

The key components of cloud infrastructure are:

Physical data centers

Compute

Network

Storage

Platform-as-a-Service is a cloud computing model that provides customers with a complete platform—hardware, software, and infrastructure. 

The high level of abstraction, support services, runtime environments, rapid deployment mechanisms, and middleware capabilities distinguishes PaaS clouds.

 PaaS advantages are:

Scalability

Faster time to market products and services.

Greater agility and innovation

Software-as-a-Service is a cloud offering that provides users with access to a service provider’s cloud-based software. 

SaaS characteristics are:

Multitenant architecture 

Security, compliance, and maintenance

Customization of applications

Subscription model

Scaling

SaaS advantages are:

Direct procurement of solutions

Improved workforce productivity and efficiency

Enable distribution of software costs

Lesson 2 Summary: Deployment Models
In this lesson, you have learned:

Deployment models indicate where the infrastructure resides, who owns and manages it, and how cloud resources and services are made available to users. There are four main deployment models available on the cloud—public, private, hybrid, and community.

In the public cloud model, the service provider owns, manages, provisions, and maintains the physical infrastructure such as data centers, servers, networking equipment, and storage, with users accessing virtualized computing, networking and storage resources as services.

In the private cloud model, the provider provisions the cloud infrastructure for exclusive use by a single organization. The private cloud infrastructure can be internal to the organization and run or on-premises. Or it can be on a public cloud, as in the case of Virtual Private Clouds (VPC), and be owned, managed, and operated by the cloud provider.

In the hybrid cloud model, an organization’s on-premise private cloud and a third-party, public cloud are connected as a single, flexible infrastructure that leverages the features and benefits of both Public and Private clouds.

In the community cloud model, the provider provisions the cloud infrastructure for use by a community of organizations with shared concerns. One or more of the organizations in the community, a third-party provider, or both are responsible for the ownership, management, and operation of this infrastructure.

### Summary
```
Lesson 1 Summary: Cloud Infrastructure
In this lesson, you have learned:

Cloud infrastructure consists of data centers, storage, networking components, and computing resources.

Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based version of physical resources, made possible by hypervisors. 

A few different types of Virtual Machines can be provisioned on the cloud. These include:

Shared or Public Cloud VMs that are provider-managed, multi-tenant deployments that can be provisioned on-demand with predefined sizes

Transient or Spot VMs that take advantage of unused capacity in a cloud data center

Reserved VMs that allow you to reserve capacity and guarantee resources for future deployments 

Dedicated hosts that offer single-tenant isolation

Bare metal servers are single-tenant physical servers that are dedicated to a single customer. Bare metal servers fulfill the demanding needs of high-performance computing (HPC) and data-intense applications. They are ideal for applications that have a high degree of security or compliance requirements.

Networking capabilities in the cloud are delivered as a service rather than in the form of rack-mounted devices. Cloud resources such as VMs (or VSIs), storage, network connectivity, and load balancers are deployed into subnets within Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). Using private and public subnets allows users to deploy multi-tier enterprise applications securely. Load balancers distribute the traffic and allow applications to be responsive.

Containers are executable units of software in which application code, its libraries, and its dependences are packaged in a common way, so that it can be run anywhere, from desktops, traditional IT, to the cloud. Containers are more lightweight and consume fewer resources than Virtual Machines, helping streamline the development and deployment of cloud native applications. 


Lesson 2 Summary: Cloud Storage and Content Delivery Networks
In this lesson, you have learned:

Cloud storage is available in four main types–Direct Attached, File, Block, and Object Storage. These storage types differ in how they can be accessed, the capacity they offer, how much they cost, the types of data they are best suited to store, and their read-write speed.

Direct Attached (or Local) Storage is storage that is presented directly to a cloud-based server and is effectively either within the host server chassis or within the same rack.

File Storage is typically presented to compute nodes as a Network File System (NFS), which means that the storage is connected to compute nodes over a standard ethernet network.

Block Storage is presented to compute nodes using high-speed fiber connections, typically provisioned in volumes, which are mounted onto a compute node.  

Object Storage is accessed via an API and doesn’t need an underlying compute node. 

Object Storage offers infinite capacity as you can keep adding files to it and just pay for what you use. Compared to the other storage types, object storage is slowest in terms of read and write speeds. 

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed server network that accelerates internet content delivery by delivering temporarily stored or cached copies of website or media content to users based on their geographic location.

### Additional Notes: 
Which of the following VMs use hosted hypervisors? 
A. Open-source KVM
B. Oracle VirtualBox
C. Microsoft Hyper-V
D. VMware ESX 


Open-source KVM: KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a type 1 or bare-metal hypervisor, not a hosted hypervisor. It runs directly on the host hardware without requiring a separate underlying operating system.

Oracle VirtualBox: VirtualBox is a type 2 or hosted hypervisor. It runs as an application on top of an existing host operating system (like Windows, macOS, or Linux) and allows you to create and manage virtual machines. (The answer is B)

Microsoft Hyper-V: Hyper-V is a type 1 or bare-metal hypervisor. It runs directly on the hardware without the need for a separate host operating system.

VMware ESX: VMware ESX (now part of VMware vSphere) is a type 1 or bare-metal hypervisor. It also runs directly on the hardware without a separate host operating system.  


Which of the following is a geographic area or location where a Cloud provider’s infrastructure is clustered?

A. Warehouse 
B. Networking
C. Data center
D. Region


A region in cloud computing refers to a geographic area or location where a cloud provider's infrastructure is clustered. It typically consists of multiple data centers that are in relatively close proximity to each other, often within the same country or continent. (Answer is D. Region)

Data center is a physical facility where servers, storage systems, networking equipment, and other IT infrastructure are housed. Data centers are typically located within regions and are part of the cloud provider's overall infrastructure.

Warehouse is a term that generally refers to a large storage facility for goods, materials, or merchandise. It does not specifically relate to cloud computing infrastructure.

Networking refers to the practice of connecting computer systems and networks together for communication purposes. It is a broader term and does not specifically refer to a geographic area where cloud infrastructure is clustered.

Which part of a logically segmented cloud network is the main area where security is implemented?   

A. Logical instances of networking elements
B. Networking spaces
C. Load balancers
D. Subnets

Subnets are logical subdivisions of an IP network. In cloud environments, subnets are used to segment and organize different parts of the network. Security measures such as network access control lists (ACLs), security groups, and routing rules are typically applied at the subnet level to control traffic flow and enforce security policies. (The answer is D. )

Logical instances of networking elements refer to virtual instances of networking components (such as virtual routers, firewalls, etc.) within the cloud environment. While security may also be implemented at these instances, the primary enforcement typically occurs at the subnet level.

Networking spaces is not a standard term in cloud networking. It might refer to IP address ranges or address spaces allocated for networking purposes, but it doesn't directly relate to where security is implemented.

Load balancers are network devices that distribute incoming network or application traffic across multiple servers. They are crucial for scalability and availability but are not the main area where security policies are enforced in a logically segmented cloud network.
