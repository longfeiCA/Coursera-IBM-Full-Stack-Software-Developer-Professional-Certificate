Lesson 1 Summary: Introduction to Cloud Computing

In this lesson, you have learned:

Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing resources over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis; resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned among multiple users and scale up and down in response to users’ needs.

The origins of cloud computing can be traced back to the mainframes of the 1950s, with virtualization technologies and hypervisors serving as catalysts for the emergence of modern-day cloud computing.

Organizations must consider their business needs, investment viability, and risk capacity to create a cloud adoption strategy that delivers desired benefits without causing business disruptions and security, compliance, or performance issues.

Cloud adoption is growing faster than predicted. Driving this technological wave are cloud service providers with a host of services ranging from Infrastructure, Platform, and Software services. Some major Cloud providers of our time include AWS, Alibaba Cloud, Google, IBM, and Microsoft Azure.


Lesson 2 Summary: Business Case for Cloud Computing
In this lesson, you have learned:

The adoption of cloud technologies enables enterprises, big and small, to be agile, innovative, and competitive and to create differentiated customer experiences. Organizations are asking not whether they should move to the cloud but rather what strategy they should adopt to move to the cloud.

Some case studies that demonstrate the impact businesses have created by adopting the cloud:

American Airlines adopting cloud technologies to deliver customer value rapidly across its enterprise

UBank leveraging cloud platform services to give more control to their developers, thereby removing barriers to innovation

Bitly leveraging the scalability offered by cloud infrastructure for low-latency delivery to its geographically  dispersed enterprise customers

ActivTrades leveraging the infrastructure, storage, network, and security offerings on the cloud to accelerate execution and delivery of new functions in their online trading systems to their customers


Lesson 3 Summary: Emerging Technologies Accelerated by Cloud
In this lesson, you have learned:

Emerging technologies powered by the cloud are disrupting existing business models and creating unprecedented opportunities for businesses to grow, innovate, and create value for their customers.

Some case studies that demonstrate how the use of emerging technologies on the cloud is creating value for millions around the world:

The use of the Internet of Things on the cloud to combat poaching of endangered rhinos in South Africa

Artificial Intelligence on the cloud is being leveraged to deliver unique digital experiences to millions of fans around the world by the United States Tennis Association

Blockchain on the cloud helps farmers reduce waste by building traceability and transparency in the food supply chain

The use of data analytics for driving predictive maintenance solutions for a city’s infrastructure by KONE

### Summary

Lesson 1 Summary: Service Models
In this lesson, you have learned the following:

With IaaS, the cloud provider manages physical resources. 

With PaaS, the provider manages the platform infrastructure. 

In the SaaS model, the provider hosts and manages the applications and data.

Infrastructure-as-a-Service is a form of cloud computing that delivers fundamental computer, network, and storage resources to consumers on-demand, over the network, on a pay-as-you-go basis. 

The key components of cloud infrastructure are:

Physical data centers

Compute

Network

Storage

Platform-as-a-Service is a cloud computing model that provides customers with a complete platform—hardware, software, and infrastructure. 

The high level of abstraction, support services, runtime environments, rapid deployment mechanisms, and middleware capabilities distinguishes PaaS clouds.

 PaaS advantages are:

Scalability

Faster time to market products and services.

Greater agility and innovation

Software-as-a-Service is a cloud offering that provides users with access to a service provider’s cloud-based software. 

SaaS characteristics are:

Multitenant architecture 

Security, compliance, and maintenance

Customization of applications

Subscription model

Scaling

SaaS advantages are:

Direct procurement of solutions

Improved workforce productivity and efficiency

Enable distribution of software costs

Lesson 2 Summary: Deployment Models
In this lesson, you have learned:

Deployment models indicate where the infrastructure resides, who owns and manages it, and how cloud resources and services are made available to users. There are four main deployment models available on the cloud—public, private, hybrid, and community.

In the public cloud model, the service provider owns, manages, provisions, and maintains the physical infrastructure such as data centers, servers, networking equipment, and storage, with users accessing virtualized computing, networking and storage resources as services.

In the private cloud model, the provider provisions the cloud infrastructure for exclusive use by a single organization. The private cloud infrastructure can be internal to the organization and run or on-premises. Or it can be on a public cloud, as in the case of Virtual Private Clouds (VPC), and be owned, managed, and operated by the cloud provider.

In the hybrid cloud model, an organization’s on-premise private cloud and a third-party, public cloud are connected as a single, flexible infrastructure that leverages the features and benefits of both Public and Private clouds.

In the community cloud model, the provider provisions the cloud infrastructure for use by a community of organizations with shared concerns. One or more of the organizations in the community, a third-party provider, or both are responsible for the ownership, management, and operation of this infrastructure.
